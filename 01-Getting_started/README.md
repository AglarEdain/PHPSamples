# Section 1 - Getting started

In this section, we'll see very basic concepts you need to understand to start with PHP.

Dive into the subsections to read a brief text and open files to see source code.

## Summary

1. Section one
   1. [HTML file before PHP](01-HTML_before_PHP) : Write down an `.html` file before we really start
   2. [Hello World](02-Hello_World) : Display _Hello, World!_ just like every beginner in every programming language

## Disclaimer

Remember: PHP may change in the future, see the *official documentation* if you're in trouble. (Link in README.md at the root of this repo.)
