# Subsection 1.1 An HTML file before we start using PHP

In this very first subsection, I will show you an _HTML_ file.

We will make this file evolve in the next subsections.

This file displays `Section One : Hello, World!` as a first heading (**H1**).

Then as **H2** `Coolio` and **H3** `1 2 3 4`. Finally, we add a few lyrics from this song.

You kown?

## Lyrics

> 1-2-3-4 get your woman on the floor\
> Gotta gotta get up to get down\
> Gotta gotta get up to get down
> 
> 1-2-3-4 get your woman on the floor\
> Gotta gotta get up to get down\
> Gotta gotta get up to get down
> 
> What up everybody so glad you're here\
> It's Coolio with the flow back in your ear\
> This ain't a fantastic voyage\
> But I'm still on a mission to see if I can\
> Get your attention
