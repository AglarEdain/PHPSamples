# PHPSamples

Just a bunch of few examples for PHP newbies.

You should have notions of HTML and CSS for understanding those samples.

## About the author

My nickname is *AglarEdain*.

I'm a web developer from France.

I started coding in Quick Basic back in the nineties, when I was teenager, on old computers running MS DOS at highschool. Then on my own PC under Windows 95.

Quickly, I wanted to go forth, installing Linux, coding in PERL, trying to learn ANSI C by myself. (Spoiler alert: It wasn't a success.)

Finally, I bought a 56K modem, discover Internet and the World Wide Web. Surfing with this strange noise, I was sure it was **THE FUTURE**! So I tried coding my own HTML 4.01 webpages.

And the journey didn't end. I bought an O'Reilly *Webmaster in a nutshell*, a thick book which still in my book shelf. And I started to code on Debian my first PHP3 scripts.

24 years later, a lot of things changed. I've chosen to change my job and had a training. I'm no more self-taught but I can claim being a real professional web developer. 

I write those lines on a MacBook running an old macOS High Sierra ; PHP had many new versions and became object oriented. PHP8 is still widly used.

So I brought to you this repository. If you are completly new to programming, I hope It will help you.
